## Features

- ✨ Purchased Wishlist items are now routed to the Wishlist handler instead of being added to the Selling List — they are removed/updated on the Wishlist as expected.
- ✨ Added Max Price Drop / Min Listings Below settings for both WTS (selling) and WTB (buying) to control auto-pricing follow behavior — prevents following large price drops unless enough competition is present (closes #108).
- ✨ Added Syndicate live scraper mode — new TradeMode, filtering by standing cost/volume/syndicate/rank, and dedicated processing pipeline for syndicate items (hidden behind dev flag) (WIP).
- ✨ Added `operations` filtering to WFM order pagination — allows filtering backend orders by their current operation set.

## Fixes

- 🛠️ Moved `notify_gui!` call inside the Critical/Error check in `live_scraper/client.rs` to prevent GUI notifications for non-critical log levels.
- 🛠️ Fixed purchased Wishlist items appearing in the Selling List instead of being handled on the Wishlist (closes #116).
- 🛠️ Fixed Auto Delete deleting blacklisted item orders on Live Scraper start — blacklist now checks sub_type (e.g. riven rank) so items like "Longbow Sharpshot" are properly skipped (closes #114).
- 🛠️ Fixed analytics crash on startup by guarding `set_last_user_activity` behind `HAS_STARTED` check.
- 🛠️ Added `[Info]: OnTradeAccepted failed` detection — trade state is now properly reset when the trade dialog is not accepted, preventing the auto-pricer from getting stuck (closes #117).

## Refactors

- ♻️ Consolidated `SubType` struct into the `utils` crate — removed duplicate definitions from `entity::dto` and `qf_api::types`, unified all imports across the codebase.
- ♻️ Moved `OperationSet` into `ItemEntry` for live scraper progress stages — operations are now tracked on the entry itself and passed by mutable reference, enabling syndicate and future modes to update operation state.
- ♻️ Split `app/client.rs` into `types/app_state.rs` (AppState struct), `modules/ws.rs` (WebSocket lifecycle), and `modules/auth.rs` (login/validate/auth flows).
- ♻️ `AppState::new()` now returns `Result` instead of panicking — WFM client creation failure is propagated upward.
- ♻️ `User::load()` and `Settings::load()` failures log to `app_init.log` before falling back to defaults.

## Dev Notes

- 🔧 Improved frontend error handling with typed error handlers for `PromiseRejectionEvent`, `ErrorEvent`, and generic `Error` — errors now include structured cause, component, and properties for better debugging.
- 🔧 Syndicate live scraper tab and settings panel are hidden behind `import.meta.env.DEV` flag.
- 🔧 `UpdateAvailableModal` no longer requires `app_info` prop — update check is also triggered on startup independently.
- 🔧 Cleaned up unused `TauriTypes` import and optional `app_info` parameter in `checkForUpdates`.
